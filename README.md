**Photoshop Scripts**

These scripts have been tested with Adobe Photoshop CC 2014 and ExtendScript Toolkit, 
but will likely work with older versions of Photoshop.

To run a script, open Photoshop and ExtendScript Toolkit, open the script, and hit run.

Read the block comment at the top of the script for detailed instructions.
